# Dex Stubber
Generate stub JAR files from DEX files.

## Usage
Open the project in any IDE of choice and configure it with the libs inside the lib/ directory. Once you run the program, a file chooser popup will show where you can select the DEX file to convert. Keep in mind that this will also be the output directory and your stubbed jar file will be named `inputName.jar`.
